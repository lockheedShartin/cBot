## Plugin Installation

1. Make sure you are using a modern browser of some sort(preferably firefox or google)
2. Follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/Lor-Saba/Code-Injector#Installation) for installing the injector browser plugin/extension

## Setup
1. Open the plugin/extension by clicking on its icon in the top right of your browser(or wherever your browser of choice shows its plugins)
2. Click "add rule" in the bottom left of the window
3. In the top, where it says "URL pattern", input `https://courses.letu.edu/*`
    this determines what page(s) the JS runs on and is very simple to modify to your needs([syntax](https://github.com/Lor-Saba/Code-Injector#rules-structure))

4. Copy the [source](https://github.com/lockheedShartin/cBot/blob/main/revisedjewbot.js) into the space under where it says "Type your JavaScript code here"
5. Make sure only the "On Page Load" box is checked in the bottom left
6. Click **save** in the bottom right

## Usage
Disclaimer: this is still decently buggy so expect to have to babysit it

Go to either the quiz summary page(where it says "take quiz") or to the quiz itself where you can see the first question on screen and do the following
Click the injector extension and click the arrow to the right of the "rule" you made which will open a context menu. From there, **enable** the rule.
Open the context menu and click **inject**



BEFORE YOU GO TO ANOTHER QUIZ, JUST RESTART YOUR BROWSER. (this will be fixed at some point)

**Do NOT close the tab or the browser while it is working or you WILL lose your progress unless you know how to harvest the data.**

## Troubleshooting
- If(when) you notice the page has stopped reacting, open the context menu for the rule you made and click **inject**.
  This will recover the process from halting from going too fast
- If it has completely crashed and you **have** to harvest the data so you can restart the browser and continue, let me know
